# Huffman data compression

## How to implement:
Run the HuffmanCode.py file.
Two options will be presented, input 1 for regular compression. Input 2 for compression with encoding from a different text file.
Input the absolute file path(s). must be in same directory as HuffmanCode.py
If compiled/decompiled successfully, conformation messahe will appear, along with file size.
This will also create a compressed file and a decompressed file in the directory of the input file
